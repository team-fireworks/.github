  <h1>We are Team Fireworks!</h1>
</div>

We are a group of friends making forbidden incantations of Roblox games for fun. Based mostly around Southeast Asia. Our mission is to create offbeat, radical worlds for you to explore and conquer, and importantly: fireworks.

              Project Vulcan is an experiment of JToH-style tower games, with refined lens for storytelling,
              gameplay, and exploration, an early alpha set to be released near early 2025.

              Succeeding from the Potentially Fire Pillars and the Total Fire Towers pair, it takes place
              in a Caelum 40 years later, set ablaze by a superflare.
